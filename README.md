The task at hand is to train the algorithm to recognize which 
English word is pronounced in an audio recording.

The model for the training is a convolutional neural  network 
for  one  dimensional  analysis  with  three  layers  and  its
configuration was done with the Sequential function of Keras library.
Two optimization models were tried, the Stohastic Gradient Descent and Adam, of which the latter
yielded the greatest accuracy.  The fitting was performed with batch size of 32,  the epochs used
were 20 and the accuracy of the model reached 0.8981.

Unfortunately, the dataset cannot be made available due to university's policy.
